# Immediate Temperature

Immediate temperature is the value that the player's temperature will eventually reach.

For example, if the player is freezing in a tundra, then immediately enter a desert, the player's temperature will still be freezing, but the player's immediate temperature will be warm. Immediate temperature can be determined with a [thermometer](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Items/Thermometer.md)
