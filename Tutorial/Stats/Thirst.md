# Thirst

A typical in all survival mods, thirst naturally decreases overtime.

Water can be regerated by:
- Drinking water sources
- Drinking potions
- Eating [foods that give water](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Stats/Thirst.md#water-altering-foods)

Having the [refreshed](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Status%20Effects/Refreshed.md) effect will temporarily stop the player's natural loss of water.

When the player's thirst goes below 15, the player will recieve the [dehydration](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Status%20Effects/Dehydration.md) effect.

Some effects that will decrease the player's thirst are [dysentery](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Status%20Effects/Dysentery.md) and [hypernatremia](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Status%20Effects/Hypernatremia.md).
