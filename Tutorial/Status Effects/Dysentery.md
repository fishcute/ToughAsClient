Dysentery will drop the player's [thirst](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Stats/Thirst.md) faster. The player will also occasionally throw up, putting the player into sneak position.

This effect can be acquired by drinking unsanitary water ([Water types](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Miscellaneous/Water%20Types.md))
