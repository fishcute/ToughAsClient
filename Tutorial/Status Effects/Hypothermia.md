Hypothermia will randomly stop the player from moving hotbar slots. When an item is "frozen" to the player's hand, a [status message](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Miscellaneous/Status%20Message.md) will be sent to the player. When active, the player's FOV will decrease.

This effect will be applied when the player's [temperature](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Stats/Temperature.md) goes below 8°. If the player's temperature goes above 22° and 42°, the remaining time will go down faster.
