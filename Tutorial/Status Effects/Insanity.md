Insanity is a very complicated effect. While active, it will do various things such as:
- Player will uncontrollably move around randomly.
- Player's selected hotbar slot will randomly change.
- Player will have the [darkness](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Status%20Effects/Darkness.md) effect applied randomly.
- Player will recieve random [status messages](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Miscellaneous/Status%20Message.md).
- Player will hear random sounds.
- Something will be communicating with the player.

This effect will be applied when the player's [sanity](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Stats/Sanity.md) is below 5.

*Something is watching...*
