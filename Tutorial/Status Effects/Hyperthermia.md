Hyperthermia will force the player to drop their items if they hold them for too long. A [status message](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Miscellaneous/Status%20Message.md) will be sent to the player.

This effect will be applied when the player's [temperature](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Stats/Temperature.md) goes above 74Â°.
