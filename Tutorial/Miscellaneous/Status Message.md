# Status Message

Status messages are used to inform the player of something.

When a status message is played, it will be shown above your right bars ([Thirst](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Stats/Thirst.md), [Stamina](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Stats/Stamina.md), and [Temperature](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Stats/Temperature.md) by default)

Status messages can inform the player if they are thirsty, tired, cold/hot, and other things.

*A status message at the bottom right of the screen*
