# Water Types

There are five different types of water types

Water types:
- OCEAN: Consists of ocean and beach biomes, Gives the [Hypernatremia](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Status%20Effects/Hypernatremia.md) effect when drunken
- SWAMP: Consists of the swamp biome, Gives the [Dysentery](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Status%20Effects/Dysentery.md) effect when drunken
- LAKE: Consists of lake, river, and jungle biomes, Has a chance to give the [Dysentery](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Status%20Effects/Dysentery.md) effect when drunken
- NORMAL: All other biomes, Has a low chance to give the [Dysentery](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Status%20Effects/Dysentery.md) effect when drunken
- SANITARY: Water cleaned with the [UV sterilizer](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Items/UV%20Sterilizer.md), Gives the [Refreshed](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Status%20Effects/Refreshed.md) effect when drunken

A biome's water type can be determined using the [water testing kit](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/Tutorial/Items/Water%20Testing%20Kit.md)
