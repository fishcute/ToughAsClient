# Cleaned Water

Cleaned water can be created using the [UV Sterilizer](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/tutorial/UV%20Sterilizer.md). Cleaned water can be in any biome, and will prevent
[Dysentery](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/tutorial/effects/Dysentery.md) and [Hypernatremia](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/tutorial/effects/Hypernatremia.md) from being
applied when the player drinks from the water source. Cleaned water has 3 uses, and as it is used up more, less sparkle particles will be displayed.

Cleaned water will stay if attached to another water source, but will be removed if the water source is destroyed.

*Cleaned water, as shown below*
