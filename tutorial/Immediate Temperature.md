# Immediate Temperature

Immediate temperature is the value that your temperature will eventually reach.

For example, if you are freezing in a tundra, then enter a desert, you will still be freezing, but your immediate temperature will be a lot warmer. Immediate temperature can be determined with a [Thermometer](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/tutorial/Thermometer.md)
