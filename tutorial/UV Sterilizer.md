# UV Sterilizer

The UV Sterilizer can create [Cleaned Water](https://github.com/fishcute/ToughAsClient/blob/main/tutorial/Cleaned%20Water.md) when used.

ID: *UV Sterilizer, minecraft:comparator*

Usage: Right click on a 1x1x1 source of water. If the player moves further than one block away from the source, or stops holding the UV sterilizer, the sterilizing will be cancelled. After 5 seconds of sterilizing, the water source will be cleaned.

While the UV sterilizer is being used, sparkle particles will be displayed, and the player will swing their main hand.
